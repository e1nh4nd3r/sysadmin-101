# What Linux System Administration Is (And Isn't)

Linux System Administration is a complex and multi-faceted occupation.  Most engineers in this field wear many hats including Developer, Quality Assurance Engineer, Operations/NOC Engineer, and Subject Matter Expert or Tech Lead.  Modern System Administration in Linux environments are typically extremely dynamic and encompass large numbers of different programming languages, computing platforms (such as Amazon Web Services [AWS], Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine [GCE], and many others), and methodologies.

Linux System Administration _is not_ simply maintaining server or service availability.  Companies can (and usually do) pay small armies of people very low wages to maintain systems in this way--which is why I argue that this _is not_ what Linux System Administration is about.

# First Principles
Establishing a strong foundation for Linux System Administration in a professional capacity requires that we first understand what Linux is and what it can (and often can't) do.

## Linux: The TL;DR Edition
Linux is an [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_software) operating system project that affords a large amount of freedom to its users to add, modify, and remove functionality and features from the core of the Linux operating system, called the "kernel".  This kernel is available free-of-charge on a permissive software license.  Most commercial applications such as Microsoft Windows _are not_ open source and _are not_ permissive of changes to and distribution of source code or kernels.

Linux is available in many "distributions", which are sometimes referenced as "flavors".  Among the most well known and widely-distributed are:

* [Ubuntu Linux](https://www.ubuntu.com/) (by Canonical Ltd.)
* [Debian Linux](https://www.debian.org/) (by the Debian Project)
* [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://www.redhat.com/rhel) (by Red Hat, Inc.) (this is often used in Enterprise settings)
* [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/) (by The CentOS Project, affiliated with Red Hat, Inc.) (a community-driven "fork" of RHEL)

These distributions all "share" the same kernel (core source code), but implement them in wildly different ways and bundle them together with other free software to create different experiences for their users.

Open Source Software itself is a complex topic that will not be covered in this document.  Links will be included at the bottom of this document for Recommended Reading.

## Which distribution will this course be using?
Since Ubuntu is among the most populous of distributions available (in terms of how many installations there are in the world), and its compatibility with other Debian-based distributions (more on that later), for the purposes of simplicity, we will be using Ubuntu.

## Why not RHEL or CentOS?
(Author) While RHEL and CentOS may be useful, I'm not as familiar with them and can't speak anywhere remotely authoritatively on them.
