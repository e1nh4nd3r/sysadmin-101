# sysadmin-101
A repository of useful exercises to learn the very basics of Systems Administration.

## Who is this information/documentation/repository for?
A few friends had been asking me about where they might start to learn the basics of how to become a Systems Administrator really get their career in technology moving.  A couple of them have been in retail and customer-facing roles and are looking to move out of that role.  In authoring this, I want to enable them as well as anyone else looking to make a move or improve their skills:

* People who have worked with computers, but don't understand the finer points of running a system or a platform
* People who have worked in other departments or adjacent fields who are looking to expand their skills
* People who are curious and want to poke around (hobbyists/tinkerers)

TL;DR: This repo is for anyone who's looking to make a move into basic systems administration.

## What's going to be covered?
* Linux OS Basics
* Client/Server fundamentals
* Linux Server fundamentals
* Networking fundamentals
* Internet fundamentals

## Why create yet _another_ set of docs?
The other reason being that flexing my writing ability through authoring public-facing documentation to help others indirectly helps my ability to communicate with other team members, teams, stakeholders, etc. much more effectively.  So, a little bit of self-directed skill-building.

## How do you propose to do this?
By breaking this topic down into two (perhaps more in the future) separate tracks, Linux and Windows, I feel as though not only can people choose the path(s) they want to follow, they can also work at their own pace.

## How can I contribute?
Discussion in the repo's Issues section is a good place to start.  Feel free to submit Issues for consideration and discussion!

Basically:

1. File an Issue
1. Make changes on a fork
1. Submit a Pull Request (PR)

Thanks!
